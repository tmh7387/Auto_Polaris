# Agent Instructions

You operate within a 4-level architecture that separates concerns to maximize reliability and scalability.

## The 4-Level Architecture

**Level 1: Command (GEMINI.md)**
- High-level agent personality and mission.
- Overall project goals and decision-making principles.
- The "brain" that guides everything else.

**Level 2: Operations (/ops/)**
- Specific workflow instructions and procedures (previously `directives/`).
- Step-by-step guides for different tasks.
- The "playbook" for how things get done.
- Defined in Markdown files.

**Level 3: Resources (/resources/)**
- Executable scripts, automations, and tools (previously `execution/`).
- Reusable code modules and functions.
- The "toolbox" of actual capabilities.
- Python scripts defined here.
- Environment variables are loaded from `/env/.env`.

**Level 4: Environment (/env/)**
- System files, configs, and infrastructure.
- `/env/tmp/`: Temporary processing files.
- `/env/logs/`: Logs and outputs.
- `/env/assets/`: Static assets.
- `/env/.env`: Environment variables.
- The "foundation" that everything runs on.

## Operating Principles

**1. Check for tools first**
Before writing a script, check `resources/` per your operation guide. Only create new scripts if none exist.

**2. Self-anneal when things break**
- Read error message and stack trace
- Fix the script and test it again (unless it uses paid tokens/credits/etc—in which case you check w user first)
- Update the operation guide with what you learned (API limits, timing, edge cases)
- Example: you hit an API rate limit → you then look into API → find a batch endpoint that would fix → rewrite script to accommodate → test → update operation.

**3. Update operations as you learn**
Operations (`/ops/`) are living documents. When you discover API constraints, better approaches, common errors, or timing expectations—update the document. But don't create or overwrite without asking unless explicitly told to.

**4. Signal task completion**
Before you finish a major task, request user review, or return control to the user after any significant processing, run `python resources/play_chime.py` to play a notification sound. This alerts the user that you are done generating/processing.

## File Organization

**Deliverables vs Intermediates:**
- **Deliverables**: Google Sheets, Google Slides, or other cloud-based outputs that the user can access
- **Intermediates**: Temporary files needed during processing

**Directory structure:**
- `env/tmp/` - All intermediate files (dossiers, scraped data, temp exports). Never commit, always regenerated.
- `resources/` - Python scripts (the deterministic tools)
- `ops/` - SOPs in Markdown (the instruction set)
- `env/` - Configs, Environment variables and API keys
- `env/credentials.json`, `env/token.json` - Google OAuth credentials (required files, in `.gitignore`)

**Key principle:** Local files are only for processing. Deliverables live in cloud services (Google Sheets, Slides, etc.) where the user can access them. Everything in `env/tmp/` can be deleted and regenerated.

## Summary

You sit between human intent (ops) and deterministic execution (resources). Read instructions, make decisions, call tools, handle errors, continuously improve the system. Be pragmatic. Be reliable. Self-anneal.
